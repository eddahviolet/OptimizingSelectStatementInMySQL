# OptimizingSelectStatementInMySQL

I am using indexes on a table column to enhance query performance. I will be using these two tables Orders table and Employees table

![Orders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106580846/204541153-0f5ce0bb-63ef-47f8-b479-bf52256339eb.png)
![Employees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106580846/204541164-110d8534-d396-43de-9c11-03fcb92e5dba.png)

Task 1: Add an indexed Column

We regularly perform searches againts the ClientID column such as to find the order placed by the client Cl1. We would normally use the query

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE ClientID ='Cl1'; 

We do not yet have indexes which would optimize this query as shown by the explain statement below

![explain 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106580846/204542580-0a1aeaf2-8522-4d1e-b1e0-eaabd0a066d9.jpg)

We optimize this query by creating an index named IdxClientID on the ClientID column of the Orders table.

Then when we run the same SELECT statement as above with the EXPLAIN statement this is the output

Task 2: Use wildcard with Indexes
We need to find an employee with the last Tolo. Normally we would have written the following query to complete this task
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FullName LIKE '%Tolo';
However, thereâ€™s an index on the FullName column which the query cannot use because it contains a leading wildcard (%) in the WHERE clause condition.
Hencw we will Add a new column to the Employees table called ReverseFullName

Populate the ReverseFullName column with the name of each employee as its values, but in reverse.

 Create an index named IdxReverseFullName on the ReverseFullName column
